The focus of APT-GRAPH is the detection of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). More specifically, the aim is to study proxy log files and to detect a domain used as Command and Control (C2) by an APT. The implemented algorithm models the traffic by means of a graph and tries to detect infections by looking for anomaly within the graph. The algorithm has been designed to work closelly with an analyst. This analyst can work interactively with a set of parameters and adapt the algorithm to focus on a specific type of APT.


## Requirements

- Java 8
- Apache Maven


## Maven modules

### Main modules

- **apt-graph**: is the parent module. It allows the build and the testing of all the modules at once.
- **core**: defines Objects and Classes used by the Batch Processor and the Server. It mainly defines the similarities used to build the graphs.
- **batch**: contains the Batch Processor. The Batch Processor is the module of the algorithm preprocessing the data .
- **server**: contains the JSON-RPC Server. The Server gives access to a set of parameters. With these parameters the Server is able to interactively complete the processing of the graph and gives the results to the UI (using JSON-RPC).
- **website**: contains the UI (HTML/JavaScript). This UI lets the analyst choose parameters needed by the Server and gives a visualisation of the results (computed graph and ranking list of suspicious domains).


### Auxiliary modules

- **integration**: checks that the Batch Processor and the Server work smootly together.
- **infection**: is an additional tool to simulate infections in a provided proxy log file.
- **traffic**: is an additional tool to study the traffic intensity of a provided proxy log file.
- **study**: is an additional tool allowing an in depth impact study of a given parameter on the detection. This tool uses Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) to evaluate the impact.
- **config**: is an additional tool which helps to generate configuration files used by the study tool.


## Quick Start

Get the latest version from GitHub.
```
git pull
```

Build all the modules together.
```
cd apt-graph
mvn clean install
```

Run the Batch Processor to build the graphs.
```
cd ../batch
./analyze.sh -i <proxy log file> -o <graphs directory>
```

There is a test file in _batch/src/test/resources/_. Use the following command to check the Batch Processor with the test file:
```
./analyze.sh -i ./src/test/resources/1000_http_requests.txt -o /tmp/mytest/
```

Run the server.
```
cd ../server
./start.sh -i <graphs directory>
```

By default, the UI is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the JSON-RPC Server is at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

There is a folder in _server/src/test/resources_/ containing dummy graphs. Use the following command to check the Server with these graphs:
```
./start.sh -i ./src/test/resources/dummyDir/
```

Connect to the UI using a browser (http://127.0.0.1:8000). Choose your parameters as shown on the screenshots below and click on "Apply" to get the result.

If everything is alright you should get something like this:

## Algorithm

### Core

The Core defines the similarities used to compute the k-NN graphs of each user. The used similarities are the following:

* Time similarity:  
  $$
  \mu_{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{1+|\Delta t|}
  $$
  with $\Delta t$ defined as the temporal difference between the request timestamps (in second).

* Domain name based similarity:
  $$
  \mu_{dom} = \frac{\beta}{\beta_{tot}}
  $$
  with $\beta$ defined as the number of common labels between the two domain names, starting from the Top Level Domain (TLD), TLD excluded but equal to each other; $\beta_{tot}$ defined as the biggest number of labels between the two domain names, TLD excluded.


â€‹	e.g.: _edition.cnn.com_ and _cnn.com_ have $\beta=1$, $\beta_{tot}=2$ and $\mu_{dom}=0.5

### Batch Processor

The Batch Processor is composed of the following processing steps:
1. parse a proxy log file (squid or JSON format);
2. split the data by user;
3. build k-NN graph of requests for each similarity and each user;
4. select the children requests among the neighbour requests (optional)
5. compute graph of domains for each similarity and each user;
6. store all necessary data in graphs directory (user graphs (_ip.address.ser_), list of users (_users.ser_), list of subnets (_subnets.ser_), k vallue (_k.ser_)).


### Server

The Server is composed of the following processing steps:
1. load the data of users selected by the analyst (_ip.address.ser_, _users.ser_, _subnets.ser_, _k.ser_);
2. merge similarity graphs for each user;
3. merge all user graphs;
4. prune the merged graph;
5. compute clusters in the graph (deprecated);
6. filter large clusters (deprecated);
7. clean the graph based on white listing (optional);
8. compute the rank list of suspicious domains.


### UI

The UI gives access to the following parameters:
* user or subnet;
* weights for fusion of the similarities;
* pruning threshold (absolute value or z-score);
* maximum cluster size (absolute value or z-score);
* white listing settings (optional): _on the go_ white listed domains, minimum number of requests by domain and by user;
* weights of ranking indexes.
